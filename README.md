# Mission-Pinball-based-on-future-animation-movie
Hi that's fantastic to see you on that project. We all like movies and enjoy pinball games. How cool is that to participate with the creation of a full playing station such as a pinball game. We can start imagining how to build a serie 10 pinball games based on the theme of an animation movie which just started filming or has just been scenarised. We want to work at the root of the design of the movie. This participative work will give us a lot of accomplishment as we plan to put one pinball machine in every cinemas the film will be projected. Our mission is to build that adventure from scrap to amazing worldwide success. Here is the very efficient ressource we need to accomplish all the building steps. So please enjoy it and leave feedback. We can use to platform slack to perform all the design aspects needed. 

We start using that framework https://missionpinball.com/
